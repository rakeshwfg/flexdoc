   - Click **Save** (if there's a save button)

3. **Wait 2-5 minutes** for the first deployment

## Step 2: Verify Deployment

1. Go to the **Actions** tab:

2. You should see a workflow called **"Deploy GitHub Pages"** running

## Why Am I Getting 404?

The 404 error happens because:
1. ❌ GitHub Pages is not enabled in repository settings
2. ❌ The first deployment hasn't completed yet
3. ❌ The workflow needs to run (automatic after enabling)

Once you enable GitHub Pages with source "GitHub Actions", the workflow will:
- ✅ Automatically run
- ✅ Build your Jekyll site
- ✅ Deploy to GitHub Pages
- ✅ Make it live at https://rakeshwfg.github.io/flexdoc

## Need Help?

If you still have issues after enabling:
1. Check the Actions tab for error messages
2. Make sure the workflow completed successfully
3. Try the manual trigger option above
4. Wait a few more minutes (sometimes takes 5-10 minutes)

**The most common issue is simply forgetting to enable GitHub Pages in Settings!**
